        <h1>Situation where I had an ethical decision to make</h1> 
          <p>A couple of years ago, when I was a head chef of a bar, one of my staff members started to have problems and arguments with the rest of the staff. </br> 
            The situation was getting worse and worse every day, to the point where this person started to show up late and didn't have the best performance during their shifts. </br> 
            At this point I had plenty of evidence to be able to dismiss this person - but after meeting with them about it, I realized that they were having serious problems with alcohol. </br> 
            I brought up this issue with our boss, and we decided that instead of dismissing them we were going to help them to find mental help with a counsellor, and encourage them to attend AA meetings.</p>
        <h1>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h1>
          <p>Something good that I think I take from my culture is the value of working hard when I get committed to a project, and not giving up until it is completed. </br>
            Alongside this, I always like working in a team environment where everybody is working together to reach the same goal.
          </p> 
        <h1>Strengths that might help me in my learning journey</h1>
          <p>One of the strengths that I'm most proud of is my determination to accomplish my commitments and that I hardly ever give up on things, no matter how hard the challenge is.</p>
        <h1>My experience when I tried to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension</h1>
          <p>When I first got the promotion to the head chef position I was underestimated by my staff members, so it was pretty hard for me to be taken seriously at the beginning. </br> 
            After a period of hard work guiding by example, and always working as a team, I was able to break through that tension. </br>
            Everything was much easier from that point, and people respected me much more.</p>
