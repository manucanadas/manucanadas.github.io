        <h1>Situation where I had an ethical decision to make</h1> 
          <p>This situation happended a couple of years ago, when I was a head chef of a bar and one of my staff members started to have problems and arguments with the rest of the staff, this situation was getting worse and worse everyday at the point where this person started to show up late and didn't have the best performance during the shifts. At this point I had plenty of evidence to be able to fired this person but after talking with him about it I realized that he was having serius problems with alcohol, so talking with the boss we desided that intead fired him we where are goint to help him to find mental help and AA meetings.</p>
        <h1>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h1>
          <p>Like any other culture, it has good and bad thinks, so I always try to take what I think is good and try not to reproduce what I belive is wrong, I belive my cultural background is an important part of my personality, one example of something good that I think I take from my culture is the value of working hard when I get commited to a project, make myselve respect when people don't respect what they promised and if I don't like it feel fre to live, nobody is forcing me to do something taht I don't want</p> 
        <h1>Strenghts that might help me in my learning journey</h1>
          <p>One of the strenghts that I'm most proud of is my determination at the moment of acomplish my comitments and that I hardly give up on thinks, no mather how hard the challenge is.</p>
        <h1>My experience when I tried to work productively with others, but there was resistence or tension</h1>
          <p>When I first got the promotion to the head chef position I was underestimated by my staff members so it was pretty hard to make myselve taken serius, but after a some time of hard work guiding with the example and always working as a team I was able to break that resistency and tension and after that moment everything went fine</p>
