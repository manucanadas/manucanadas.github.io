            <h1>Three new thing I've learned about myself and my ego</h1>
              <p>One of the most important think that I learned is the idea of developing my EQ, the ide of growth mindset, <br/>
                 Coming from a fixed academy backround, the idea of learnig new skills and learning how to learn them fascinates me and gives me the motivation to don't give up.<br/>
                 Talking about my ego, I would say that I'm deceloping the skill of asking, I'm learning that is not shame on asking even the most dumb questions,<br/>
                 Some times asking a simple question I the right moment can save us a lot of time, and also taht question can help others with the same or similar dought.<br/>
                 I've also improve my time managing skills, this is something that I would like to keep improving.
              </p>
              
            <h1>The role of values, empathy and self awarness in learning and programming</h1>
              <p>I belive that the role of this human-skills are escential in programing learning proccess, <br/>
                Knowing that most of the time we are going to be working in team environments, developing this skills will help us in the moment when we have to interact with others,<br/>
                listening others ideas, put your self in others boots and having the empathy of undestanding others are crusial skills that employers are looking for.  
              </p>
                  
            <h1>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
              <p>What surprised me the most was the contant changes in the learning proccess methods,<br/>
                 The idea of developing our EQ as much as our IQ fascinates me .
              </p>
            
            <h1>What are the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
              <p>The most challenging aspects of the core learning was and it still is the developing of time managing skills.</p>

            <h1>Why is a programing school spending so much time focusing on core learning in a weeb development bootcamp course?</h1>
              <p>I belive that EDA spend soo much time in developing this non-technical skills because they know that employers don't look just for people with good technical skills.<br/>
                 They also look for people with great human-skills, people with the ability to understand their own emotions, manage then and use then in a positive way.
              </p>

            <h1>Is spending time in studing core learning a waste of time?</h1>
              <p>Honestly at the begining of the course it was exactly what I thought, I did't understang why we where spending so much time in thi aspect,<br/>
                 but when I learned and undertood a bit more about it, I completly change my mind.
              </p>

            <h1>My long term goal and/or career pathway</h1>
              <p>My long term goal is to be able to grow profetionaly in a programminhg word.<br/>
                 Been a forein person I would love to have the possibility of finding a stable job with the chance of traveling and work remote.
              </p>
            
            <h1>What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
              <p>I belive taht my biggest strengths will be my capacity on working in teams, I always loved to do some team work, having the possibility of taking different roles in the group,<br/>
                 and also learning from the other group members,
                 I think that one of my main limitations will be the language barrier, now that we've finished fundations I realized that something that I din't think was going to be a problem,<br/>
                 I can say now it is, I've noticed that it took me lot of extra time to understand what the challenges were asking me to do.
                
              </p>

            <h1>What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be?</h1>
              <p>Apart from the understanding of the english language, that is an every day learning journey, I would like to improve the skill of recognising when is time to ask for help.<br/>
                 I feel like some times I waste to much time stuck in a situation, that it could be easly solve by asking for help in the right momment.
              </p>

            <h1>What non-technical skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</h1>
              <p>I would like to develop the skill of recognising the right momment to ask for help.</p>

            <h1>What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp?</h1>
              <p>I have high expectations of myself, coming back to school after so many years, and diving into a complete new word for me is super exciting.<br/>
                 I expect that every day is going to be something new to lern, and I hope that I can be kind and patience with my self when I get stuck,<br/>
                 Knowing that I'm going trought a new and difficult experiece full of big challenges, but every single one of them come with a biggest reword once we solve them.<br/>
                 I'm looking foward to meet new people to transit this path with.
                 And last but not less important, I EXPECT TO HAVE FUNNNN!!!
