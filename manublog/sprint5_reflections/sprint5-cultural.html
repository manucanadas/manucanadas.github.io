            <h1>Three new thing I've learned about myself and my ego</h1>
              <p>One of the most important things that I learned is the idea of developing my EQ, or the idea of growth mindset. <br/>
                 Coming from a fixed academy backround, the idea of learnig new skills and learning how to learn them fascinates me and gives me the motivation not to give up.<br/>
                 Talking about my ego, I would say that I'm developing the skill of asking, I'm learning there is no shame in asking even the most dumb questions,<br/>
                 Sometimes asking a simple question at the right moment can save us a lot of time, and also that question can help others with the same or a similar doubt.<br/>
                 I've also improve my time managing skills, this is something that I would like to keep improving.
              </p>
              
            <h1>The role of values, empathy and self awarness in learning and programming</h1>
              <p>I believe that the role of these people-skills are essential in the programming learning process, <br/>
                Knowing that most of the time we are going to be working in team environments, developing these skills will help us when we have to interact with others.<br/>
                listening to others' ideas, putting yourself in others' boots and having the empathy of understanding others are crucial skills that employers are looking for.  
              </p>
                  
            <h1>What has surprised me the most about the core learning?</h2>
              <p>What surprised me the most was the constant changes in the learning proccess methods,<br/>
                 The idea of learning "how to learn" and the different ways and methods we have to develop our learning process is a new concept that I would like to embrace.<br/>
              </p>
            
            <h1>What are the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
              <p>The most challenging aspects of the core learning was and still is the developing of time management skills.</p>

            <h1>Why is a programming school spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h1>
              <p>I believe that EDA spend so much time in developing these non-technical skills because they know that employers don't look just for people with good technical skills.<br/>
                 They also look for people with great people-skills, people with the ability to understand their own emotions, manage them and use them in a positive way.
              </p>

            <h1>Is spending time in studying core learning a waste of time?</h1>
              <p>Honestly at the beginning of the course it was exactly what I thought, I didn't understand why we were spending so much time in this aspect,<br/>
                 but when I learned and understood a bit more about it, I completely changed my mind.
              </p>

            <h1>My long term goal and/or career pathway</h1>
              <p>My long term goal is to be able to grow professionaly in the programming world.<br/>
                 Been a foreign person I would love to have the possibility of finding a stable job with the chance of travelling and working remotely.
              </p>
            
            <h1>What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h1>
              <p>I believe that my biggest strengths will be my capacity to work in a team, I have always loved to do team work, having the possibility of taking different roles in the group,<br/>
                 and also learning from the other group members.<br/>
                 I think that one of my main limitations will be the language barrier, now that we've finished foundations I realize that it was  something that I didn't think was going to be a problem.<br/>
                 I can say now that it is, I've noticed that it took me a lot of extra time to understand what the challenges were asking me to do.
                
              </p>

            <h1>What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be?</h1>
              <p>Apart from the understanding of the english language, that is an everyday learning journey, I would like to improve the skill of recognising when is time to ask for help.<br/>
                 I feel like some times I waste too much time stuck in a situation, that it could be easily solved by asking for help in the right moment.
              </p>

            <h1>What non-technical skills would I like to see developed in myself while at EDA?</h1>
              <p>I would like to develop the skill of recognising the right moment to ask for help.</p>

            <h1>What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp?</h1>
              <p>I have high expectations of myself, coming back to school after so many years, and diving into a completely new world for me is super exciting.<br/>
                 I expect that every day there is going to be something new to learn, and I hope that I can be kind and patient with myself when I get stuck.<br/>
                 Knowing that I'm going through a new and difficult experience full of big challenges, but every single one of them come with a bigger reword once we solve them.<br/>
                 I'm looking forward to meeting new people to transit this path with.
                 And last but not lest, I EXPECT TO HAVE FUN!!!
