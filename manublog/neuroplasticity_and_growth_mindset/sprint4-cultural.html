        <h1>How understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people?</h1>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is the abililty of the brain to adapt to changes in an individual's environment by forming new neural connections over time. </br>
             It has been proven that people's brains are constantly changing, this changes take time and work. and understanding this would help us to use it in our own benefit.</br>
             This changes will be achieved through lots of practicing and studing.  
          </p>
        <h1>How might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for our own benefit?</h1> 
            <p>A way to engage with the principals of neuroplasticity is trying new experiences, to stablish new neural pathways.</br>
               This neural pathways are going to be our new "motorways" that connect out neurons, this connection is called synapses.</br>
               Once we understand that our brains are in constant changing, and we can control this changes through practice, we can star using neuroplasticityin our own benefit.
             </p>

                  <li>Massed practice: The heavy repetition of a certain skill or activity strengthens neural connections.
                </li>
              </ul>

        <h1>What is Growth Mindset and why is relevant?</h1>
          <p>It's very relevant because when we understand that our abilitys can be develop, we can use it to learn anything we like.</br>
             Understanding this will help us to work hard and spend much more time practicing or studing, knowing that any goal is reachable with dedication,</br>
             And it also will help us to enjoy the learning procces and not to give up when be get frustrated.
          </p>
        <h1>How can I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h1>
          <p>I think the best way to integrateit is by doing it, understanding that nobody have been born with programing skill and we all need to develop them</br>
             Understand that we are all diferent and we need time to absorb this new concepts,<br>
