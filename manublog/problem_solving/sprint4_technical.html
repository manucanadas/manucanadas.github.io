        <h1>What was the problem?</h1>
          <p>I had problems with pretty much every single exercise of this sprint, I found myself getting stuck very often and getting very frustrated.<br/>
             It was during the FizzBuzz exercise that I first realized that I wasn't understanding what I had to do. <br/>
             I found myself looking at the tasks and not even knowing where to start.
             I think that a main problem I have is that I need to pay attention when I am reading, as I find myself having to read things multiple times before I feel like I understand.
          </p>
        <h1>What problem solving techniques did I use to help solve the problem?</h1> 
            <p>After reading the assignment multiple times and still feeling stuck, I used the rubber ducky method, and read the assignment out loud to my thermos.</br>
               Once I did this, I began with the pseudocode technique, trying to build small pieces of my code and using the technique of googling extra information to help me with this part. 
             </p> 
         
        <h1>How did I feel throughout this process?</h1>
          <p>I honestly felt super stressed out, like I wasn't understanding the subject of the assignment.</br>
             To an extent I still feel this way but I did make some progress as well.
          </p> 
        <h1>What did I learn?</h1>
          <p>What I have learnt is that I am wasting far too much time trying to solve these problems by myself.</br>
             Reaching out to my cohort or to my facilitators more often would help me learn things much quicker, and that is what I should be doing more often.</br>
             I just need to be confident to do that, because there is no shame in reaching out for help.</br>
             
          </p>
