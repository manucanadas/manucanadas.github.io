        <h1>Analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h1>
          <p>
            Once upon a time, there were two friends. Their names were HTML and CSS. As a job, they were both in construction, and were building a house together.</br>
            On the house-building project, HTML and CSS both had different skills and responsibilities.</br>
            HTML was in charge of building the structure of the house - he built all the walls, the floor, the roof, and the doors and windows.</br>
            CSS was in charge of all the painting and decorating of the house - he chose the carpets, the wallpaper, the colour and shape of the window- and door-frames, and the design of the roof.</br>
            Together, HTML and CSS built the most functional and best looking house in the whole neighborhood.</br>
            This house was also for themselves! They lived in the finished house happily ever after!

        <h1>Control Flow and Loops</h1> 
          <p>Control Flow is the term we use to describe the order in which the computer executes the statements.</br>
             It's important because if we want something to happen we can control it by using the different statements, for example: if, else, else if.</br>
             If we want to repeat the statments we have to use the loops, so we can use them over and over again also using different statements, for example: for, while.
          </p>
        <h1>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</h1>
          <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a independent interface that treats an HTML and CSS document as a tree structure where each node is an object representing a part of the document.</br>
             These objects can be manipulated, that means we can access, create, remove and change them on the DOM via Javascript.</br>
             We can also interact with our code via Devtools, by using this tool we can create, remove and change statements in any website code, but after we refresh the site the elements will return to the original state.
          </p> 
        <h1>Difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects</h1>
          <p>To access data from an Array, you refer to it with the index number.</br>
             To access data from an Object, you have to refer to the object by using a dot or brackets.
          </p>
        <h1>what are Functions and why are they useful?</h1>
          <p>Functions can be described as a "formula" where we can organize our code to do a specific action and then reuse it as many times as we want.</br>
