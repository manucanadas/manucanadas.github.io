        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
          <p>It's the ability that people have to undertand their and other people emotions and the skill of manage those emotions in positive ways.</br>
             This is not an ability that we born with. It's an ability we have to train it to develop.
          </p>
        <h1>What is IQ?
          <p>Intelligence quotient (IQ), is a measure of a person's reasoning ability.</br>
             It is a way to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to solve problems. 
        </p>  
        </h1>  
        <h1>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h1>
          <p>The difference between IQ and EQ is that while IQ is the measure of a person's relative intelligence and the ability of use the logic to solve problems.</br>
             EQ is the ability to identify and manage your emotions and other people emotions, and have a better approach at the moment of solving a problem, considering other people opinions to slove the problem in the best way possible.
          </p> 
        <h1>Why is EQ so important?</h1>
          <p>We can't say that EQ is more important that IQ, bouth of them are parts of our intelligence.</br>
             What we can say is as child we have been educated in a way that cares more about developing our IQ that our EQ (school sistem).</br>
             So it's important to develop our EQ so we can improve our skill of looking at a problem from different points of view and try to find the best solution.</br>
             Developing our EQ will give us the chance to improve our Performance, Leadership skills and happines.
