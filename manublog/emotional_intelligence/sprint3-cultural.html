        <h1>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
          <p>It's the ability that people have to understand their own emotions, and the emotions of other people - and the skill of managing those emotions in positive ways.</br>
             This is not an ability that we are born with, it's an ability we have to develop.
          </p>
        <h1>What is IQ?</h1> 
            <p>Intelligence quotient (IQ), is a measure of a person's reasoning ability.</br>
               It is a way to gauge how well someone can use information and logic to solve problems. 
             </p> 
         
        <h1>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</h1>
          <p>The difference between IQ and EQ is that while IQ is the measure of a person's relative intelligence and the ability to use logic to solve problems.</br>
             EQ is the ability to identify and manage your emotions and other people's emotions, considering other people's opinions to solve a problem in the best way possible.
          </p> 
        <h1>Why is EQ so important?</h1>
          <p>We can't say that EQ is more important that IQ, both of them are equal parts of our intelligence.</br>
             What we can say is as children we have been educated in a way that cares more about developing our IQ than our EQ (the school system).</br>
             But it's important to develop our EQ as well, so we can improve our skill of looking at a problem from different points of view and trying to find the best solution.</br>
             Developing our EQ will give us the chance to improve our performance, leadership skills and happiness.
