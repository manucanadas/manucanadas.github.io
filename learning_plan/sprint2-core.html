          <h1>My long term goals</h1>
            <p>To be honest, my long term goal is to find a job I can rely on, in a job industry that is secure and well-paid. </br> 
               Learning the skills from this industry will allow me to be more creative with technical projects as well, to be able to combine technical learning and design. </br>
               I chose this career path because this industry also has the opportinuity for a flexible working environment - and this course will hopefully give me skills that I can use to work from anywhere in the world.
            </p>
          <h1>Non-technical skills that I would like to develop</h1>
            <p>I would like to use this learning opportunity to improve my communication skills mostly - especially as a lot of the time I will need to be working in a team. </br> 
               I also know that I need to improve my focus, to be able to dedicate my time and energy in the right way as I am completing tasks.
            </p>
          <h1>Strengths and Limitations</h1>
            <p>I think one of my biggest strengths, that is actually also one of my biggest limitations, is my stubbornness. </br> 
               As a strength it gives me determination and commitment to any task - and as a weakness it can mean that I sometimes find it hard to be flexible with my ideas. </br>
               I also think a strength that I have is my ability to work in a team, to give support and to be easy-going in a collaborative environment. </br>
               Another limitation that I have is that I find it difficult reach out and ask for help - often I feel like I get stuck trying to solve a problem by myself for too long before asking for assistance.
            </p>
          <h1>How I would seek for help in a timely way</h1>
            <p>I have to work on recognising the moment when I actually get stuck in the first place, so then I can reach out for help as soon as I hit those points instead of struggling for longer.</br>
               Often when I am stuck it is because of something that seems simple, but I have forgotten - which is easier for someone with an outside perspective to help me fix.
            </p>
          <h1>What do I expect from the facilitation team?</h1>
            <p>As well as being available to contact - especially while we are all working from home but even once we are on the campus - it will be good to have the facilitators checking in with me on a regular basis.
            </p>
